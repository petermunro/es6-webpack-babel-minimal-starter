# es6-webpack-babel-minimal-starter
A minimal ES6 / ES2015 starter template using Webpack &amp; Babel

## To Use

```
npm install webpack -g
npm install jquery
npm install
webpack
```

Then navigate using a browser to `build/index.html`.

The sample `js/app.js` imports and uses jQuery, but only as an example.
It's not a `package.json` dependency, so you'll need to `npm install jquery`
too if you want to use it.
